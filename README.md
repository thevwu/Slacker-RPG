# Slacker-RPG
An uncompleted update to a game I was working on before college took over, averaged 80 players a day.  Hosted on my own server.

If you wish to view these .DM files, it is suggested that you view them in BYOND's Dream Maker compiler.
If you do not wish to download this software, you can use any text editor or compiler to view it.  I suggest Notepad++.

The UI(Slacker RPG.DMF) is not viewable unless in Dream Maker or running the game.  I have included a few screenshots here:
